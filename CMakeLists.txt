# Rudimentary CPack support.
#
# CPack provides a mechanism to generate installation packaging for a project,
# e.g., self-extracting shell scripts, compressed tarballs, Debian Package files,
# RPM Package Manager files, Windows NSIS installation wizards,
# Apple Disk Images (.dmg), etc.
#
# Any system libraries required (runtimes, threading, etc) should be bundled
# with the project for this type of installation. The
# `InstallRequiredSystemLibraries` CMake module attempts to provide this
# functionality in an automated way. Additional libraries may be specified as
#
# ```cmake
# list(APPEND CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS <library>)
# ```
#
# A packaged installation can be generated by calling
#
# ```sh
# cpack -G <packaging type> --config CPackConfig.cmake
# ```
#
# See `cpack --help` or the CPack documentation for more information.
